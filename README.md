Yeah, I did rewrite it, again

# Building

its maven, go figure.  
install also installs the jar into /testserver/plugins, if you don't want that use package.

# Dev Setup

the test server is packaged with the server. 
you just need to grab a spigot jar and create a run config like this:

(important stuff: single instance only, run mvn install, change working dir to test server)
